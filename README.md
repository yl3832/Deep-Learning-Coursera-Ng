# Deep-Learning-Coursera-Ng
I finished the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization given by Ng in 2017 with massive work. The courses are on going. 
The specialization includes five parts:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning:(Finished)
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization:(Finished)
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects:(Finished)
4. Convolutional Neural Networks:(Studying)
5. Sequence Models:(Pending)
